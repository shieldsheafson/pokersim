# Poker Sim
This was a personal project to help first get better at python, and then later to help me learn c. The python implementation and the c implementation should have the same outputs, however, the c implementation is much much faster. At some point in the future, I may come back and revise the c version to make it faster and make the code clearer.

## Building
There isn't an in built build system for this project, so just use whatever. The c implementation and the python implementation do **not** depend on each other, so you only need compile one.
